      "description": "Hundreds of satellites and rockets launched into space are left as space junk once they no longer work. An estimated millions of pieces of debris currently orbit the Earth, traveling fast enough to damage or destroy a spacecraft or satellite that happens to be in its path. These objects remain in orbit until gravity pulls them back to Earth, potentially remaining in space for decades.",

How safe are astronauts on the ISS and why does their research help mankind in general? What happens with space debris distributed in orbit?\n\nIn the online course “Space Safety”, the astronaut Dr Thomas Reiter, experts from the European Space Agency (ESA) and other research institutions address the subject matter, presenting possible future scenarios for space applications.\n\nThe individual course units cover an array of topics, such as space weather, space debris, collision avoidance, cyber security and space medicine.",

      "description": "This course is an intuitive introduction to rocket science in our everyday lives. Modern life increasingly depends on technology provided by Earth-orbiting satellites, from detailed weather predictions to broad-band internet and GPS. How are satellites launched into orbit and how do they work once they get there? Why are rockets used to get into orbit and how are they different from airplanes? This introductory course is aimed at a wide non-technical audience and is appropriate for all ages.",
